#Exercise 5: Take the following Python code that stores a string:
''' Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string
after the colon character and then use the float function to convert
the extracted string into a floating point number.'''

str1 = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
str1.find(':')
sl_str1 = float(str1[19:])
